Recall the [Assignment](https://github.com/cs50spring2021/tse-labs/tree/main/indexer).

**Total: 80/100 points**

## (10) Overall

9/10 points:

* (-1) `indexer` directory contains executable file `indexer` which should be ignored by your .gitignore
* try to use more descriptive git commit messages

## (10) Makefiles

10/10 points

## (10) Documentation

9/10 points

* Note: you should change the top level README to contain your name and GitHub username!
* (-1) `IMPLEMENTATION.md` should be more detailed - you should discuss your functions in `indexer.c` in addition to your functions in `index.c`

## (10) Testing

9/10 points:

* (-1) `indexer/testing.sh` should contain good comments about your test cases

## (20) Coding Style

18/20 points

* (-2) for coding style. You should include more comments in your code, especially function header comments. Also, you should add a space after keywords like `if` and `else`. I would suggest reviewing the [CS 50 style guide](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs50/Labs/CodingStyle.html)

## (30) Functionality

15/30 points:

* (-15) incorrect `indexer` behavior. Your program creates a file `indexFilename` but does not write the index to that file - the index gets printed to stdout. The format and content of your printed index is also incorrect. I would suggest reviewing the assignment's `REQUIREMENTS.md`.

## (10) Memory leaks, according to valgrind

10/10 points
